# homework_6A
bonus:
1. one picture carousel with 3 rotational pictures implemented in the product detail page. ( done in hw5, count towards hw6a)
2. interesting js feature: used chrome native alert modal as pop up to serve as a double confimation for users. I chose this over a customized pop up since it is more accessiible to screen reader users with vision impairment.

thanks!
